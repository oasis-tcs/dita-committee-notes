        <section><title>Scenario</title>In this scenario, a user is reading the online help for a
            software product. By default, the product does not display all of the advanced menu
            items. Users reading the documentation while viewing the software application have
            become confused when they did not see all of the menu items that are described in the
            documentation. The solution is for the users to change their preferences so that the
            application shows all menu items.</section>

                condition, cause, and remedy:</p>

            </simpletable>
            <p>Writers should limit the content of the
          <xmlelement>note</xmlelement> element to discussing the
        condition, cause, and remedy expressed in a single step. If the
        content of the remedy requires a list, then the writer should
        redesign the content so that the instructions are in a separate
        troubleshooting topic.</p>
